# ToDoList
A basic CRUD application that lets you add, delete, update and display your tasks.


# Flask-Todolist
Flask-Todolist is a simple To Do List web application with the most basic features of most web apps, i.e. entries, API and (somewhat) interactive UI. 

## Manually
If you prefer to run it directly on your local machine, I suggest using virtualenv, anyway here the commands you have to enter:
* Clone or Download the files in your system
* In the terminal: 
   * $ python app.py
The app opens in your local server.

## Extensions
* Flask
* Flask-SQLalchemy
* Virtualenv
